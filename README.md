DOCUMENTATION

We have created a react app that generates password of any given length

Here we have given four constraints ,according to that password is generated

After password gets generated we get a pop up notification saying password is generated if we have not checked any of the constraints it asks you to select any of the one boxes.
   
Also there is a little pop up notification that indicates that the “Password is generated successfully”.
This is done by implementing the TOASTIFY

Toast Notifications are popup messages that are added so as to display a message to a user


CONCLUSION

Overall, a password generator React app is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to generate secure and random passwords with ease. Whether you're a professional who needs to manage multiple accounts or an individual who wants to keep your online accounts secure, this app provides a fast and convenient way to generate strong passwords.
